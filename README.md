# Sudoku-Solver
This is my sudoku solver, this is one of the first projects I decided to create.

I created this project because I regularly enjoy playing sudoku as a pass-time. 
I saw the idea for this project online and I thought I would try and create it myself in the language I am currently most prominent in: Python
The way this program works:
A very large list of lists is inputed (an array) to fit the format of a sudoku puzzle, because I can't literally input a perfectly formatted sudoku puzzle, this was the best I would be able to do with it.
Any number that is already defined within the puzzle will have that number itself displayed in the array
If there is a blank space in the puzzle that is represented by -1, you can change the input or add more puzzles by following this format
If a puzzle is solvable, it will return the solved puzzle, if the puzzle is not solvable, it will return that this sudoku puzzle is impossible to solve

Thank you for reading and I hope to work on and add more projects as I delve deeper into the coding world!
